# Solution-to-Equations-of-Motion-for-Underwater-Glider
Equations of motion towards underwater glider were formulated at Princeton by Graver in his PhD work in 2005.Various marine engineers use them to develop different guidance, navigation and control system towards efficient functioning of the glider.This code simulates the results of Graver (2005) towards solving equations of motion of underwater glider. The MATLAB code is properly commented for the input parameters to be used in simulation of glider motion. Our request is just to cite our code in your work where you are using the MATLAB code.

The folder comprises of simulation for 2D motions of underwater glider as specified in the thesis of the Graver (2005) towards development of equations of motion. 

In order to properly understand the code, it is highly recommended to go through following work :
Graver, Joshua Grady. Underwater gliders: Dynamics, control and design. Diss. PhD thesis, Princeton University, 2005.
